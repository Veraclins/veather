# Welcome to Veather

Your daily weather app powered by [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## OverView

Veather is a simple weather app that displays the weather reports of top 15 most populated cities in the world by default as well as the report of the current city of the user when the user gives it location access. It also has a search input through which you can search any city around the world and get the current weather report of that city.

## Features

The main features of the app are

### Load the report of popular cities around the world

The app by default loads the reports of the top 15 most popular cities (based on population) around the world and saves it in the browser memory. These reported are then listed on the cities page (doubles as the home page) as shown below




### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
